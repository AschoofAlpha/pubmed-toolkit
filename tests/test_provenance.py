"""
Tests for search provenance carried through papers_*.json.

Why this exists: `search_pubmed` knew the esearch term, the hit count and
whether the result was cut off at `retmax`, but all of it stayed inside the
function and went out with the log. `papers_*.json` was a bare list, so the
profile report had to rebuild a guess from whatever config it was run with
later, and reported the truncation gate as `unknown` — a gate that could never
fire. A corpus silently cut off at retmax was indistinguishable from a complete
one, and every count in the report would have been wrong by an unbounded amount
with nothing saying so.

Run: python tests/test_provenance.py
